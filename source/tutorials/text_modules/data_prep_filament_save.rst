If you finished picking, you can export your box files with :guilabel:`File` -> :guilabel:`Save`. Training data is created for all images that have an activated checkbox. Create a new directory called :file:`boxes` and save it there. The boxmanager will now ask you for a :guilabel:`box distance`. By default it is set to 10 percent of your box size and you can keep the default. Then close boxmanager.
