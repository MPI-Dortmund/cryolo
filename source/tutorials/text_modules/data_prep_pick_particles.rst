Here is how to pick particles:

First you need to create a new layer for picking particles. Switch to the tab :guilabel:`Organize_layer` and click :guilabel:`Create particle layer`. I assume that your only have one image stack open, in case you don't please adapt :guilabel:`Target image layer` accordingly.

* :kbd:`LMB`: Place a box
* Hold :kbd:`LMB`: Move a box
* :kbd:`Control` + :kbd:`LMB`: Remove a box
* :kbd:`h` KEY: Toggle to make boxes invisible / visible

You can change the box size in the main window, by changing the number in the text field :guilabel:`Box size`:
Press :guilabel:`Set` to apply it to all picked particles. For picking, you should the use minimum
sized square which encloses your particle.

If you have images that do not contain particles but only contamination / ice you can add them to your training set by activate the checkbox in front of the image.
