Increase the contrast
"""""""""""""""""""""""

You might want to run a low pass filter before you start picking to get better contrast.
#. Switch to tab :guilabel:`bandpass_filter` and check if the default :guilabel:`LP resolution` is ok and that the extracted :guilabel:`Pixel size` is correct.
#. Press :guilabel:`Run` to get a new layer with your low pass filtered images. It will filter the images on-the-fly.
