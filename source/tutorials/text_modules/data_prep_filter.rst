You might want to run a low pass filter before you start picking. Switch to tab :guilabel:`banpass_filter` and check if the default'LP resultion' is ok and that the extracted :guilabel:`Pixel size` is correct. Press :guilabel:`Run` to get a new layer with your low pass filtered images. It will filter the images on-the-fly when you change the positions.
