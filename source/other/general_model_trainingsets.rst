General model data sets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For training the general model we used

 * 18 internal but yet not published data sets
 * 14 EMPIAR data sets,
 * 10 simulated data sets
 * 6 user contributed data sets (2 of them are apoferritin)
 * 10 particle free data sets with only contamination

At this point this site lacks information about internal and user contributed data sets.
We will provide basic information about the size as soon as possible.

From **EMPIAR** we used the data sets with the following IDs:

 * 10023
 * 10004
 * 10017
 * 10025
 * 10028
 * 10050
 * 10072
 * 10081
 * 10154
 * 10181
 * 10186
 * 10160
 * 10033
 * 10097

For the **simulated data sets** we used the following PDB models:

 * 1sa0
 * 5lnk
 * 5xnl
 * 6b7n
 * 6bhu
 * 6dmr
 * 6ds5
 * 6gdg
 * 6h3n
 * 6mpu
